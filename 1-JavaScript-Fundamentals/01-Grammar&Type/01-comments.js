// let is JavaScript version of var(variable)
// left of = is name, right of = is value
// variable must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
// can't name variable with a number as first character
// no spacing allowed for variable name
// standard practice is 'camo-case' autumnIsCool (start with lowercase, all other words start uppercase)

// JS is CASE SENSITIVE

// const is another keyword for variable and it makes the variable constant, so it won't change
// const means you can't reasign the variable

// JS is precise up to the 15th number. The 16th number and up gets rounded.
// Same for decimals, it will round, so math is not always precise. WATCH FOR THIS
